# government
Governmentâ„¢ - by the committers, for the committers.

What if all facets of life were under version control? What if making a change to the government was as simple as a pull-request?

Think of it:

1. You create a change to the government.
2. A set of test "standards" are created (by committee, a necessary evil).
3. You submit a pull request
4. If all tests past, your changes are merged - the government has evolved!
5. Regressions can be checked, and transparency is unparalleled.
